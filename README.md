# pi-dashboard

This is palceholder reop for a future project where I plan on creating a smart home integrated controller on a raspberry pi that is interfaced with a in-wall mounted touchsreen monitor. This project's scope would be limited to interfacing with common smart home protocols and the standard array of wifi enables smart devices. There are other facets of this project that I plan to expand it into more in the future, those being sat image collection and routing for processing as well as automated C2 of mutliple common place home 3D printers.
